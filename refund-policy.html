  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective">Effective from: February 14, 2026</p>

  <p>This Refund Policy explains how refunds, cancellations, and our Weight Loss Guarantee work at SlimBloom Inc. ("SlimBloom", "we", "us", or "our"). Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase.</p>

  <h2>1. General</h2>
  <p>When you purchase a subscription to SlimBloom, you gain immediate access to your personalized weight loss plan, meal plans, exercise routines, and progress tracking tools. Because our Product delivers digital content and personalized services immediately upon purchase, standard refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  <p>We want every customer to feel confident in their purchase. If you experience any issues with the Product or have concerns about your subscription, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@slimbloom.com">support@slimbloom.com</a> and we will work with you to find a resolution.</p>

  <div class="guarantee-box">
    <h3>🏆 Our Weight Loss Guarantee</h3>
    <p>We're committed to your results. If you follow your personalized SlimBloom plan and don't see visible progress, we'll stick with you — extending your plan at no extra charge until you do. Your transformation is our promise.</p>
    <p>To qualify for a plan extension under our Weight Loss Guarantee:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must have actively followed your assigned meal plan for the duration of your subscription</li>
      <li>You must have completed at least 80% of the recommended exercise routines</li>
      <li>You must have logged your progress weekly using the tracking features</li>
      <li>You must contact us within 7 days of your plan's expiration to request an extension</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plan extensions are provided at our discretion based on your engagement and adherence data. Extensions are typically granted for the same duration as your original plan.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Subscription Renewal and Cancellation</h2>

  <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
  <p>All SlimBloom subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period. You will be charged the applicable renewal fee using the payment method on file unless you cancel before the renewal date.</p>
  <p>We will send you a reminder email before each renewal. It is your responsibility to cancel before the renewal date if you do not wish to continue your subscription.</p>

  <h3>How to Cancel</h3>
  <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@slimbloom.com">support@slimbloom.com</a> with the subject line "Cancel Subscription"</li>
    <li>Using the cancellation option in your account settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period. You will continue to have access to the Product until your paid period expires. No partial refunds are issued for unused portions of a billing period.</p>

  <h3>Refunds for Renewals</h3>
  <p>If you were charged for a renewal that you did not intend, please contact us within 14 days of the charge. We will review your request and may issue a full refund for the unwanted renewal period, provided you have not substantially used the Product during that period.</p>

  <h2>3. Right of Withdrawal</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Union or the United Kingdom, you have a statutory right to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days of the date of purchase, without giving any reason.</p>
  <p>However, by purchasing a SlimBloom subscription and accessing your personalized plan, you acknowledge that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Product involves the supply of digital content that is not supplied on a tangible medium</li>
    <li>Performance of the service begins immediately upon purchase with your explicit consent</li>
    <li>You acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal once the digital content has been accessed or the personalized plan has been generated</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have not accessed your personalized plan or any digital content within the 14-day withdrawal period, you may request a full refund by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@slimbloom.com">support@slimbloom.com</a>.</p>

  <h3>How to Exercise Your Right of Withdrawal</h3>
  <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision by a clear statement sent to <a href="mailto:support@slimbloom.com">support@slimbloom.com</a>. Please include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your full name and email address associated with your account</li>
    <li>The date of purchase</li>
    <li>Your order or transaction reference number</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your withdrawal request is approved, we will process the refund within 14 days using the same payment method you used for the original purchase.</p>

  <h2>4. Disputes and Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>Before initiating a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider, we kindly ask that you contact us first at <a href="mailto:support@slimbloom.com">support@slimbloom.com</a>. We are committed to resolving any billing issues quickly and fairly. Filing a chargeback without first contacting us may result in the suspension of your account.</p>
